# Hacking with Swift
Place to hold my solutions for the Hacking With Swift training series

## Project 6
In this project we fix vertical spacing for project 2 so that it will work in landscape mode, and we learn how to programmatically add constraints to our UI

## Project 7
In this project we learn how to use UITabBarController to reuse one ingterface design for multiple similar interfaces.  We also create a viewcontroller class that isn't in the storyboard, but just pushed onto the view in code.
